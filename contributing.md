# Contributing to Fingerprint Pro Server API SDK

## Structure

Most files in the project are autogenerated by [swagger-codegen](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-codegen/).

- [template](./template) - folder contains redefined templates of `swagger-codegen`. Original templates you can find in [swagger-codegen repo](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen-generators/tree/master/src/main/resources/handlebars/csharp).
- [docs](./docs) - generated documentation for models and [API Client](./docs/FingerprintApi.md).
- [src/FingerprintPro.ServerSdk](./src/FingerprintPro.ServerSdk) - API Client code is generated automatically.

## Code generation

You need `swagger-codegen` to run code generation. There are many ways described in the [readme](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen).
In the project we use local jar file `swagger-codegen-cli.jar`.

You can just run `./generate.sh` script and it will do all the work.

To download fresh OpenAPI schema run `./sync.sh`
