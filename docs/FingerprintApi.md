# **DeleteVisitorData**
> void DeleteVisitorData (string visitorId)

Delete data by visitor ID

Request deleting all data associated with the specified visitor ID. This API is useful for compliance with privacy regulations. ### Which data is deleted? - Browser (or device) properties - Identification requests made from this browser (or device)  #### Browser (or device) properties - Represents the data that Fingerprint collected from this specific browser (or device) and everything inferred and derived from it. - Upon request to delete, this data is deleted asynchronously (typically within a few minutes) and it will no longer be used to identify this browser (or device) for your [Fingerprint Workspace](https://dev.fingerprint.com/docs/glossary#fingerprint-workspace).  #### Identification requests made from this browser (or device) - Fingerprint stores the identification requests made from a browser (or device) for up to 30 (or 90) days depending on your plan. To learn more, see [Data Retention](https://dev.fingerprint.com/docs/regions#data-retention). - Upon request to delete, the identification requests that were made by this browser   - Within the past 10 days are deleted within 24 hrs.   - Outside of 10 days are allowed to purge as per your data retention period.  ### Corollary After requesting to delete a visitor ID, - If the same browser (or device) requests to identify, it will receive a different visitor ID. - If you request [`/events` API](https://dev.fingerprint.com/reference/getevent) with a `request_id` that was made outside of the 10 days, you will still receive a valid response. - If you request [`/visitors` API](https://dev.fingerprint.com/reference/getvisits) for the deleted visitor ID, the response will include identification requests that were made outside of those 10 days.  ### Interested? Please [contact our support team](https://fingerprint.com/support/) to enable it for you. Otherwise, you will receive a 403.

# **GetEvent**
> EventsGetResponse GetEvent (string requestId)

Get event by request ID

Get a detailed analysis of an individual identification event, including Smart Signals.  Please note that the response includes mobile signals (e.g. `rootApps`) even if the request originated from a non-mobile platform. It is highly recommended that you **ignore** the mobile signals for such requests.   Use `requestId` as the URL path parameter. This API method is scoped to a request, i.e. all returned information is by `requestId`.

# **GetVisits**
> VisitorsGetResponse GetVisits (string visitorId, string requestId = null, string linkedId = null, int? limit = null, string paginationKey = null, long? before = null)

Get visits by visitor ID

Get a history of visits (identification events) for a specific `visitorId`. Use the `visitorId` as a URL path parameter. Only information from the _Identification_ product is returned.  #### Headers  * `Retry-After` — Present in case of `429 Too many requests`. Indicates how long you should wait before making a follow-up request. The value is non-negative decimal integer indicating the seconds to delay after the response is received. 

### Example
```csharp
using System;
using System.Diagnostics;
using FingerprintPro.ServerSdk.Api;
using FingerprintPro.ServerSdk.Client;
using FingerprintPro.ServerSdk.Model;

namespace Example
{
    public class GetVisitsExample
    {
        public void main()
        {
            var configuration = new Configuration("YOUR_API_KEY");
            var apiInstance = new FingerprintApi(configuration);
            var visitorId = visitorId_example;  // string | Unique [visitor identifier](https://dev.fingerprint.com/reference/get-function#visitorid) issued by Fingerprint Pro.
            var requestId = requestId_example;  // string | Filter visits by `requestId`.   Every identification request has a unique identifier associated with it called `requestId`. This identifier is returned to the client in the identification [result](https://dev.fingerprint.com/reference/get-function#requestid). When you filter visits by `requestId`, only one visit will be returned.  (optional) 
            var linkedId = linkedId_example;  // string | Filter visits by your custom identifier.   You can use [`linkedId`](https://dev.fingerprint.com/reference/get-function#linkedid) to associate identification requests with your own identifier, for example: session ID, purchase ID, or transaction ID. You can then use this `linked_id` parameter to retrieve all events associated with your custom identifier.  (optional) 
            var limit = 56;  // int? | Limit scanned results.   For performance reasons, the API first scans some number of events before filtering them. Use `limit` to specify how many events are scanned before they are filtered by `requestId` or `linkedId`. Results are always returned sorted by the timestamp (most recent first). By default, the most recent 100 visits are scanned, the maximum is 500.  (optional) 
            var paginationKey = paginationKey_example;  // string | Use `paginationKey` to get the next page of results.   When more results are available (e.g., you requested 200 results using `limit` parameter, but a total of 600 results are available), the `paginationKey` top-level attribute is added to the response. The key corresponds to the `requestId` of the last returned event. In the following request, use that value in the `paginationKey` parameter to get the next page of results:  1. First request, returning most recent 200 events: `GET api-base-url/visitors/:visitorId?limit=200` 2. Use `response.paginationKey` to get the next page of results: `GET api-base-url/visitors/:visitorId?limit=200&paginationKey=1683900801733.Ogvu1j`  Pagination happens during scanning and before filtering, so you can get less visits than the `limit` you specified with more available on the next page. When there are no more results available for scanning, the `paginationKey` attribute is not returned.  (optional) 
            var before = 789;  // long? | ⚠️ Deprecated pagination method, please use `paginationKey` instead. Timestamp (in milliseconds since epoch) used to paginate results.  (optional) 

            try
            {
                // Get visits by visitor ID
                VisitorsGetResponse result = apiInstance.GetVisits(visitorId, requestId, linkedId, limit, paginationKey, before);
                Debug.WriteLine(result);
            }
            catch (Exception e)
            {

Get events via search

Search for identification events, including Smart Signals, using multiple filtering criteria. If you don't provide `start` or `end` parameters, the default search range is the last 7 days.  Please note that events include mobile signals (e.g. `rootApps`) even if the request originated from a non-mobile platform. We recommend you **ignore** mobile signals for such requests.

### Parameters

Name | Type | Description  | Notes
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
 **limit** | **int?**| Limit the number of events returned.  | 
 **paginationKey** | **string**| Use `pagination_key` to get the next page of results.   When more results are available (e.g., you requested up to 200 results for your search using `limit`, but there are more than 200 events total matching your request), the `paginationKey` top-level attribute is added to the response. The key corresponds to the `timestamp` of the last returned event. In the following request, use that value in the `pagination_key` parameter to get the next page of results:  1. First request, returning most recent 200 events: `GET api-base-url/events/search?limit=200` 2. Use `response.paginationKey` to get the next page of results: `GET api-base-url/events/search?limit=200&pagination_key=1740815825085`  | [optional]

# **UpdateEvent**
> void UpdateEvent (EventsUpdateRequest body, string requestId)

Update an event with a given request ID

Change information in existing events specified by `requestId` or *flag suspicious events*.  When an event is created, it is assigned `linkedId` and `tag` submitted through the JS agent parameters. This information might not be available on the client so the Server API allows for updating the attributes after the fact.  **Warning** It's not possible to update events older than 10 days. 

### Example
```csharp
using System;
using System.Diagnostics;
using FingerprintPro.ServerSdk.Api;
using FingerprintPro.ServerSdk.Client;
using FingerprintPro.ServerSdk.Model;

namespace Example
{
    public class UpdateEventExample
    {
        public void main()
        {
            var configuration = new Configuration("YOUR_API_KEY");
            var apiInstance = new FingerprintApi(configuration);
            var body = new EventsUpdateRequest(); // EventsUpdateRequest | 
            var requestId = requestId_example;  // string | The unique event [identifier](https://dev.fingerprint.com/reference/get-function#requestid).

            try
            {
                // Update an event with a given request ID
                apiInstance.UpdateEvent(body, requestId);
            }
            catch (Exception e)
            {
                Debug.Print("Exception when calling FingerprintApi.UpdateEvent: " + e.Message );
            }
        }
    }
}
```
