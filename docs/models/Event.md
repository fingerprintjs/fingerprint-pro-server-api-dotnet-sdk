**ClonedApp** | **bool** | Android specific cloned application detection. There are 2 values:  * `true` - Presence of app cloners work detected (e.g. fully cloned application found or launch of it inside of a not main working profile detected). * `false` - No signs of cloned application detected or the client is not Android.  | [optional]

**FactoryResetTimestamp** | **long** | The time of the most recent factory reset that happened on the **mobile device** is expressed as Unix epoch time. When a factory reset cannot be detected on the mobile device or when the request is initiated from a browser,  this field will correspond to the *epoch* time (i.e 1 Jan 1970 UTC) as a value of 0. See [Factory Reset Detection](https://dev.fingerprint.com/docs/smart-signals-overview#factory-reset-detection) to learn more about this Smart Signal.  | [optional] 
**Frida** | **bool** | [Frida](https://frida.re/docs/) detection for Android and iOS devices. There are 2 values: * `true` - Frida detected * `false` - No signs of Frida or the client is not a mobile device.  | [optional]

**Jailbroken** | **bool** | iOS specific jailbreak detection. There are 2 values:  * `true` - Jailbreak detected. * `false` - No signs of jailbreak or the client is not iOS.  | [optional] 
**LocationSpoofing** | **bool** | Flag indicating whether the request came from a mobile device with location spoofing enabled. | [optional] 
**MitmAttack** | **bool** | * `true` - When requests made from your users' mobile devices to Fingerprint servers have been intercepted and potentially modified.  * `false` - Otherwise or when the request originated from a browser. See [MitM Attack Detection](https://dev.fingerprint.com/docs/smart-signals-reference#mitm-attack-detection) to learn more about this Smart Signal.  | [optional] 
**PrivacySettings** | **bool** | `true` if the request is from a privacy aware browser (e.g. Tor) or from a browser in which fingerprinting is blocked. Otherwise `false`.  | [optional] 
**RootApps** | **bool** | Android specific root management apps detection. There are 2 values:  * `true` - Root Management Apps detected (e.g. Magisk). * `false` - No Root Management Apps detected or the client isn't Android.  | [optional] 
**RuleAction** | [**EventRuleAction**](EventRuleAction.md) |  | [optional] 
**SuspectScore** | **int** | Suspect Score is an easy way to integrate Smart Signals into your fraud protection work flow.  It is a weighted representation of all Smart Signals present in the payload that helps identify suspicious activity. The value range is [0; S] where S is sum of all Smart Signals weights.  See more details here: https://dev.fingerprint.com/docs/suspect-score  | [optional] 
**Tampering** | **bool** | Flag indicating browser tampering was detected. This happens when either:   * There are inconsistencies in the browser configuration that cross internal tampering thresholds (see `tampering_details.anomaly_score`).   * The browser signature resembles an \"anti-detect\" browser specifically designed to evade fingerprinting (see `tampering_details.anti_detect_browser`).  | [optional]
