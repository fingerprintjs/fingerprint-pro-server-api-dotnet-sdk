# Fingerprint.ServerSdk.Model.SearchEventsBot
Filter events by the Bot Detection result, specifically:
  `all` - events where any kind of bot was detected.
  `good` - events where a good bot was detected.
  `bad` - events where a bad bot was detected.
  `none` - events where no bot was detected.
> Note: When using this parameter, only events with the `bot` property set to a valid value are returned. Events without a `bot` Smart Signal result are left out of the response.
