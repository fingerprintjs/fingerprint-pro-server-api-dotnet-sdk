 * Fingerprint Pro Server API allows you to get information about visitors and about individual events in a server environment. It can be used for data exports, decision-making, and data analysis scenarios. Server API is intended for server-side usage, it's not intended to be used from the client side, whether it's a browser or a mobile device.

To learn more, see [Data Retention](https://dev.fingerprint.com/docs/regions#data-retention). - Upon request to delete, the identification requests that were made by this browser   - Within the past 10 days are deleted within 24 hrs.   - Outside of 10 days are allowed to purge as per your data retention period.  ### Corollary After requesting to delete a visitor ID, - If the same browser (or device) requests to identify, it will receive a different visitor ID. - If you request [`/events` API](https://dev.fingerprint.com/reference/getevent) with a `request_id` that was made outside of the 10 days, you will still receive a valid response. - If you request [`/visitors` API](https://dev.fingerprint.com/reference/getvisits) for the deleted visitor ID, the response will include identification requests that were made outside of those 10 days.  ### Interested? Please [contact our support team](https://fingerprint.com/support/) to enable it for you. Otherwise, you will receive a 403.
