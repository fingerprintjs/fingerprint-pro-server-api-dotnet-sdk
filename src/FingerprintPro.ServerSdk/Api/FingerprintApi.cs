 * Fingerprint Pro Server API allows you to get information about visitors and about individual events in a server environment. It can be used for data exports, decision-making, and data analysis scenarios. Server API is intended for server-side usage, it's not intended to be used from the client side, whether it's a browser or a mobile device.

This API is useful for compliance with privacy regulations. ### Which data is deleted? - Browser (or device) properties - Identification requests made from this browser (or device)  #### Browser (or device) properties - Represents the data that Fingerprint collected from this specific browser (or device) and everything inferred and derived from it. - Upon request to delete, this data is deleted asynchronously (typically within a few minutes) and it will no longer be used to identify this browser (or device) for your [Fingerprint Application](https://dev.fingerprint.com/docs/glossary#fingerprint-application).  #### Identification requests made from this browser (or device) - Fingerprint stores the identification requests made from a browser (or device) for up to 30 (or 90) days depending on your plan. To learn more, see [Data Retention](https://dev.fingerprint.com/docs/regions#data-retention). - Upon request to delete, the identification requests that were made by this browser   - Within the past 10 days are deleted within 24 hrs.   - Outside of 10 days are allowed to purge as per your data retention period.  ### Corollary After requesting to delete a visitor ID, - If the same browser (or device) requests to identify, it will receive a different visitor ID. - If you request [`/events` API](https://dev.fingerprint.com/reference/getevent) with a `request_id` that was made outside of the 10 days, you will still receive a valid response. - If you request [`/visitors` API](https://dev.fingerprint.com/reference/getvisits) for the deleted visitor ID, the response will include identification requests that were made outside of those 10 days.  ### Interested? Please [contact our support team](https://fingerprint.com/support/) to enable it for you. Otherwise, you will receive a 403.

You can use [`linkedId`](https://dev.fingerprint.com/docs/js-agent#linkedid) to associate identification requests with your own identifier, for example: session ID, purchase ID, or transaction ID. You can then use this `linked_id` parameter to retrieve all events associated with your custom identifier.  (optional)</param>
        /// <param name="limit">Limit scanned results.   For performance reasons, the API first scans some number of events before filtering them. Use `limit` to specify how many events are scanned before they are filtered by `requestId` or `linkedId`. Results are always returned sorted by the timestamp (most recent first). By default, the most recent 100 visits are scanned, the maximum is 500.  (optional)</param>

When more results are available (e.g., you requested 200 results using `limit` parameter, but a total of 600 results are available), the `paginationKey` top-level attribute is added to the response. The key corresponds to the `requestId` of the last returned event. In the following request, use that value in the `paginationKey` parameter to get the next page of results:  1. First request, returning most recent 200 events: `GET api-base-url/visitors/:visitorId?limit=200` 2. Use `response.paginationKey` to get the next page of results: `GET api-base-url/visitors/:visitorId?limit=200&paginationKey=1683900801733.Ogvu1j`  Pagination happens during scanning and before filtering, so you can get less visits than the `limit` you specified with more available on the next page. When there are no more results available for scanning, the `paginationKey` attribute is not returned.  (optional)</param>
